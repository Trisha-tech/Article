               banana diseases and pests. With an average 90 percent success rate                     rate in detecting a pest or a disease, the tool can help farmers avoid                      millions of dollars in losses."

                          Built using 20,000 images that captured a variety of visible                           banana disease and pest symptoms, the app helps scan photos                           of the branch, fruits or the plant itself to detect the disease or the                           pest and then recommend the necessary steps to stem the                           disease. The app helps to record other data like the geographical                           location and integrates it in to a larger database which could
                          have global utility, according to the CIAT press release.
